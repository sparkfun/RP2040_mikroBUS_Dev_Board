[*SparkFun RP2040 mikroBUS™ Development Board (DEV-18721)*](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/18721)

The SparkFun RP2040 mikroBUS™ development board is a low-cost, high performance board with flexible digital interfaces featuring the Raspberry Pi Foundation's RP2040 microcontroller. Besides the Thing Plus or *Feather* footprint (with 18 GPIO pins), the board also includes an SD card slot, 16MB (128Mbit) flash memory, a JST single cell battery connector (with a charging circuit and fuel gauge sensor), an addressable WS2812 RGB LED, JTAG PTH pins, a mikroBUS™ socket, and our signature Qwiic connector.

_The RP2040 is supported with both C/C++ and MicroPython cross-platform development environments, including easy access to runtime debugging. It has UF2 boot and floating-point routines baked into the chip. While the chip has a large amount of internal RAM, the board includes an additional 16MB of external QSPI flash memory to store program code._

_The [mikroBUS™ standard](https://www.mikroe.com/mikrobus) was developed by [MikroElektronika](https://www.mikroe.com/). Similar to our [Qwiic](https://www.sparkfun.com/qwiic) and [MicroMod](https://www.sparkfun.com/micromod) interfaces, mikroBUS™ provides a standardized connection for add-on [Click boards™](https://www.mikroe.com/click-boards) to be hooked up to a microcontroller based development board._
